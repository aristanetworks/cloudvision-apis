// CloudVision allows users to version control provisioning operations
// that impact device configuration and image management. A workspace is
// something like a git branch, within which changes can be made without
// immediately impacting a device's running configuration. Changes can be
// made, modified, and previewed in a workspace. Once satisfied with the
// set of changes, a user may submit a workspace to the "mainline" branch,
// allowing the changes to be propagated to devices via Change Controls.
//
// A workspace comprises a set of diff operations (e.g., add/modify/remove)
// that will be applied to the mainline if the workspace is submitted
// successfully.
//
// A workspace itself is generic and can be used for any conceivable
// set of device provisioning operations, but it is not capable of
// describing the specific kind of changes. Rather, it holds changes
// defined by other Resource APIs that are "workspace-aware", such as
// studio.v1 and tag.v2. These APIs allow users to make changes within
// the context of a specific workspace, identified in the resource key
// with the field `workspace_id`.
