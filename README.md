# CloudVision APIs

## Introduction

Cloudvision APIs are state based, resource-oriented APIs in which resources are divided into configuration data models
(known as `config`) and operational and/or derived state models (known as `state`). Resources are modeled in
[Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and accessed over [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) with a
standardized set of RPCs.

### Documentation

Documentation for these APIs can be found [here](https://aristanetworks.github.io/cloudvision-apis).

This includes details about the common RPCs, available models, how modeling is done, available clients, and more.
